# Frontend Structure - Baseline Established

## Overview
This document outlines the current frontend structure after establishing the baseline for issue #47 (Frontend structural cleanup & architecture alignment).

## Current Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/              # Legacy contexts (partially consolidated)
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/                 # Shared hooks

## Status

### âœ… Completed (Phase 0 - Baseline)
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean compilation with zero errors
- **Build Process**: Successfully builds for production
- **Development Server**: Runs without issues
- **Core Architecture**: Feature-first structure established
- **Provider Pattern**: Centralized provider composition in `app/providers/`
- **Routing**: Centralized route definitions in `app/routing/`
- **Theme System**: Working Chakra UI v2 integration
- **Path Aliases**: Consistent import paths configured

### ðŸ”„ Legacy Structure (To be addressed in future PRs)
- Some duplication between root-level directories and `shared/`
- Mixed context locations (`context/` vs `contexts/`)
- Legacy components not yet migrated to feature modules
- Some configuration duplication

## Key Design Decisions

### Chakra UI Version
- **Decision**: Downgraded from v3.25.0 to v2.10.9
- **Reason**: v3 introduced breaking API changes that would require extensive migration
- **Impact**: Provides stable, working baseline for further development
- **Future**: v3 migration can be handled as separate task

### Architecture Alignment
- **Feature-first organization**: Each domain has its own feature module
- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation between app, core, shared, and feature layers
- **Provider composition**: Centralized provider setup following documented patterns

## Next Steps (Future PRs)

1. **Feature Migration**: Move legacy components/pages into appropriate feature modules
2. **Consolidation**: Merge duplicate directories (contexts, config, types)
3. **Chakra UI v3**: Upgrade UI library when ready
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement lazy loading, micro-frontend patterns
5. **Testing**: Expand test coverage for new architectural patterns

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Testing
npm run test
npm run test:run

# Building
npm run build

# Storybook
npm run storybook
```

## Import Patterns

```typescript
// App layer
import Component from '@/app/providers/AppProviders';

// Core functionality
import { AuthContext } from '@/core/auth/AuthContext';

// Shared utilities
import { httpClient } from '@/shared/api/httpClient';

// Feature modules
import { RagPage } from '@/features/rag/pages/RagPage';

// Theme
import theme from '@/shared/theme';
```

This baseline provides a solid foundation for continued frontend development following the documented architecture principles.
