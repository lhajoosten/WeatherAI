# Location Groups - User Organization & Future Analytics

## Overview

Location Groups provide users with the ability to organize their saved weather locations into logical clusters for better management and future analytics aggregation. This feature enables grouping locations by geographic regions, personal categories, or any custom organization scheme.

## Data Model

### LocationGroup
- **id**: Primary key
- **user_id**: Foreign key to users table (ownership)
- **name**: Group name (e.g., "East Coast", "Office Locations", "Vacation Spots")
- **description**: Optional description of the group
- **created_at**: Timestamp when group was created

### LocationGroupMember
- **id**: Primary key
- **group_id**: Foreign key to location_groups table
- **location_id**: Foreign key to locations table
- **added_at**: Timestamp when location was added to group

### Constraints & Indexes
- Unique constraint on (group_id, location_id) to prevent duplicate memberships
- Index on (user_id, name) for efficient group lookups
- Cascade delete: when group is deleted, all memberships are removed
- Cascade delete: when location is deleted, all group memberships are removed

## API Endpoints

### Groups Management
- `GET /api/v1/location-groups` - List user's groups with member counts
- `POST /api/v1/location-groups` - Create new group
- `DELETE /api/v1/location-groups/{group_id}` - Delete group and all memberships

### Membership Management
- `POST /api/v1/location-groups/{group_id}/locations` - Add location to group
- `DELETE /api/v1/location-groups/{group_id}/locations/{location_id}` - Remove location from group
- `POST /api/v1/location-groups/{group_id}/members/bulk` - Bulk add/remove locations (NEW)

#### Bulk Membership Request Format
```json
{
  "add": [1, 2, 3],    // Location IDs to add to group
  "remove": [4, 5]     // Location IDs to remove from group
}
```

**Note**: Bulk operations are idempotent - adding existing members or removing non-members is ignored gracefully.

### Security
- All operations require authentication
- Users can only access/modify their own groups
- Location ownership verified before adding to groups
- Rate limiting applied to prevent abuse

## Use Cases

### Current Implementation
1. **Personal Organization**
   - Group home, work, and family locations
   - Organize by geographic regions (West Coast, International)
   - Create project-specific location sets

2. **Simplified Management**
   - Bulk operations on related locations
   - Quick visual organization in UI
   - Contextual grouping for different purposes

### Future Analytics Potential
1. **Comparative Weather Analysis**
   - Compare weather patterns across group locations
   - Regional climate trend analysis
   - Group-level forecast accuracy metrics

2. **Aggregated Insights**
   - Average temperatures across location groups
   - Group-wide precipitation trends
   - Comparative forecast performance by region

3. **Business Intelligence**
   - Multi-location weather impact analysis
   - Regional weather risk assessment
   - Group-based weather alerts and notifications

## Implementation Notes

### Frontend UI Patterns
- Group creation modal with name and description
- Location selection via multiselect from existing locations
- Group cards showing member count and recent activity
- Drag-and-drop interface for adding/removing members
- Visual indicators for group membership in location lists

### Backend Considerations
- Efficient eager loading of group members for list operations
- Optimistic concurrency for membership operations
- Audit trail for group operations in LLMAudit table
- Consider caching for frequently accessed group data

### Database Performance
- Index on (user_id, name) for group lookups
- Index on (group_id, location_id) for membership queries
- Consider materialized view for group statistics if needed
- Pagination for groups with large member counts

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics
- Group-level analytics dashboard
- Comparative weather charts across group locations
- Group-wide forecast accuracy reports
- Export group weather data for external analysis

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Nested groups (hierarchical organization)
- Shared groups between users (team/family groups)
- Group-based weather alerts and notifications
- Template groups for common location sets

### Phase 4: Machine Learning
- Automatic group suggestions based on location patterns
- Smart grouping by weather similarity
- Predictive analytics for group weather trends
- Group-level anomaly detection

## Migration Strategy

### Database Migration
The `add_location_groups` migration creates the necessary tables with proper foreign key constraints and indexes. This migration is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing location data.

### API Versioning
All group endpoints are under `/api/v1/location-groups` for consistency with existing API structure. Future breaking changes would require a new API version.

### Data Migration
No data migration required for existing installations. Users can optionally create groups and organize their existing locations as desired.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Group CRUD operations
- Membership management (add/remove)
- Ownership verification and security
- Data validation and constraints

### Integration Tests
- Full group lifecycle (create → add members → remove members → delete)
- Cross-user isolation (users cannot access others' groups)
- Location deletion cascades to group memberships
- Rate limiting enforcement

### Performance Tests
- Large group operations (100+ locations per group)
- Concurrent group modifications
- Database query performance under load
- Memory usage for group data loading

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- JWT-based authentication required for all operations
- User isolation enforced at database level
- Group ownership verified for all modifications
- Location ownership verified before group membership

### Rate Limiting
- Separate rate limits for group operations
- Prevent rapid creation/deletion of groups
- Limit membership operations to prevent abuse
- Monitor for suspicious group access patterns

### Data Privacy
- Groups are private to creating user
- No cross-user data exposure in group operations
- Audit logging for group modifications
- No PII in group names/descriptions by policy

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- Group creation/deletion rates
- Average locations per group
- Group membership operation frequency
- API response times for group operations

### Alerts
- High rate of group operations (potential abuse)
- Database constraint violations
- Failed group operations (user experience)
- Memory usage spikes during group loading

### Logging
- Group operation audit trail
- Performance metrics for group queries
- Error tracking for group operations
- User behavior patterns for future features
